When I left my job, what I found myself thinking about most were the 11 years of conversations around food, cultures, and memories. From day one, I built relationships at work that often turned into discussions about food, whether one-on-one or in the watercooler Slack channel. These conversations were sometimes about cooking but also about diverse cultures, personal history, and real connection.

Sometimes, a cultural holiday would be acknowledged, along with the special dishes and traditions tied to it. Other times, someone would share a picture of a birthday cake they made for their significant other. And sometimes, it was just about a Friday dinner. These moments enriched my life, expanding my perspective on how food bonds people.

Inspired by this, I saw an opportunity to create a space where people could share their food stories, traditions, and the memories they hold, just like in that Slack channel. I also wanted a space where collaboration and growth could flourish.

I also want to learn from others. I want to discover new dishes, understand how different holidays are celebrated around the world, and adopt new traditions. I want to document the dishes I cook, noting the tweaks and improvements made each time, and see photos from different years, making my cooking a journey. By sharing these experiences, users can support each other in becoming better cooks, preserving traditions, and building meaningful connections.

## The Bigger Picture - Why Is this Important?

Beyond personal connections, there’s a bigger need to preserve and share food traditions. Here’s why I believe this is so important:

On an individual level, preserving food traditions helps create a connection to heritage and identity. It nurtures memory, creativity, and a sense of belonging. On a societal level, these traditions foster empathy and understanding across generations, cultures, and ethnicities.
[Evercooked](https://www.evercooked.com/){:target="_blank"} is about more than just sharing recipes. It is about addressing real challenges:

- **Preserving and sharing food traditions:** With each generation, irreplaceable knowledge disappears, making it more urgent than ever to document and pass on these stories.
- **Fostering meaningful connections:** Social media is filled with passive consumption. How can we enable real engagement and shared experiences?
- **Revitalizing home cooking:** How can we encourage people to cook with meaning in a world fueled by convenience? How can we make cooking more than a chore and a necessity?
- **Encouraging the adoption of traditions:** How do we help people find meaning in rituals, both old and new?
- **Building self-esteem through cooking:** How can we turn the kitchen into a space for confidence, creativity, and connection like it’s been for me?
- **Celebrating occasions, both big and small:** Food is central to life’s occasions, both big and small. How can we give the proper priority to its meaning?

## Legacies Lost: The Importance of Preserving Traditions

What’s at stake when family stories aren’t captured? What’s lost when recipes are not passed down with the memories and techniques behind them? Even worse, what’s lost when recipes aren’t passed down at all?

Once a tradition is lost in a family, it’s gone, forever. My great-grandparents were immigrants, but their traditions weren’t preserved. Entire cultural identities faded away. My husband, raised in the UK by immigrant parents, holds onto parts of his family’s traditions, but some have already been lost. This sense of legacy is even more urgent for those of us without direct descendants since we risk losing not only family traditions but parts of our history, too.

This isn’t just about preserving the past. It’s about building something for the future.

## Fostering Meaningful Connections: Moving Beyond Passive Consumption

Social media is often a place of passive consumption: scrolling, liking, and, at best, commenting. Real connection and engagement are elusive. Instead of mindlessly scrolling, we can create a space where we connect over shared experiences and discuss the memories tied to a dish, exchange cooking tips, and share the stories that make our recipes unique.

It’s about building relationships with meaningful interaction and having conversations that matter. This can be a community where we celebrate each other’s cooking journeys, learn from diverse experiences, and deepen our understanding of how food connects us. It can be about the stories, the dishes, and the legacy we build together. It’s about building relationships, not just followers.

## Revitalizing Home Cooking: Finding Meaning and Confidence in the Kitchen

In a world dominated by convenience, it's easy to forget the joy and fulfillment that come from cooking at home. The kitchen can be a space for creativity, self-expression, and connection, but for many, it can also be intimidating or feel like a chore. How can we rediscover the meaning and joy in our cooking?

The key is to make the kitchen a place where confidence and creativity thrive. Meaningful cooking is about reconnecting with rituals, through family recipes or new experiments. It’s about building the confidence to create meals that connect us to our heritage and to the people we care about.

## Celebrating Occasions: Honoring Both Big and Small Traditions

Food is central to so many of life’s big occasions: birthdays, holidays, and significant life moments like weddings and funerals. It’s also central to the small moments which add up to a life worth living. Every meal, big or small, can carry meaning, and these moments deserve to be honored.

## Building in Public: Leading by Example
[Evercooked](https://www.evercooked.com/){:target="_blank"} is still in the early stages, and I’m figuring things out as I go. It’s a work in progress, but I’m committed to creating something meaningful, piece by piece. From growing a community, to developing the app, to building [a blog](https://www.evercooked.com/){:target="_blank"} and launching [a newsletter](https://evercooked.substack.com/){:target="_blank"}, every step of this process matters.

By sharing the successes, challenges, and lessons learned along the way, I hope to show that it’s possible to create something from the ground up and that you don’t need to have everything figured out to start.

If you’re working on your own project or dream, I hope this inspires you to take the first step. Building something meaningful takes courage and consistency, but we’re doing it together.

I’d love to hear from you. What food traditions do you hold dear, and what stories do you want to pass down? What do you want to build? Join me in this journey of preserving, celebrating, and sharing the food traditions that connect us all.
