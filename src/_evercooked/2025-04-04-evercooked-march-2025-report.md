This is the first in what I hope becomes a regular practice: monthly reports on [Evercookedâ€™s](https://www.evercooked.com/){:target="_blank"} growth, direction, and the lessons Iâ€™m learning along the way. Iâ€™m doing this to stay transparent, stay accountable, and lead by example especially when it comes to the messy, overwhelming parts of starting something from scratch. A few former colleagues have been sharing their own journeys publicly, and watching them do it inspired me. Maybe I can pay that forward.

March was a turning point. I finished setting up [the Evercooked blog](https://www.evercooked.com/){:target="_blank"} (using the Ruby static site generator [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/){:target="_blank"}), which finally allowed me to start publishing posts. That unblocked the newsletter. My plan is to use Substack for distribution but keep the full stories on my own domain for SEO and content ownership.

With the blog in place, I launched [the Evercooked newsletter](https://evercooked.substack.com/){:target="_blank"} and began talking publicly about the project. It felt scary and like a big step because it made the project feel real. I shared it with people I respect and whose opinions matter to me, and that vulnerability felt like progress.

I also created social media accounts and began posting. I now regret being resistant to some of these platforms earlier, like Facebook. Without much previous experience, Iâ€™ve had to learn from scratch with no followers in some cases.

Although the app is the ultimate goal, development took a back seat to content. Writing blog posts, sending newsletters, and figuring out social media took more time and energy than I expected, but it also helped clarify the direction I'm going. Iâ€™m investing this time because I want to build a community before the app is finished so thereâ€™s a foundation of early users when itâ€™s ready.

Thereâ€™s still a long way to go, but I believe sharing the early stage matters.

Hereâ€™s a look at what happened in March.

I followed the full follower list of a similar Bluesky account (2,000+), which likely led to the spike. I need to invest more time into following relevant users on other platforms. I also need to post more and create posts quicker. I will potentially set a couple of days aside to create a bunch of posts.

## Issues & Improvements

- **Trailing slash inconsistency** on URLs (some content has `/`, some doesnâ€™t)
  â†’ This can cause duplicate indexing and impact SEO
  â†’ **To-do:** Standardize URLs, fix linking, and set up redirects or canonical tags

## Reflections

### Wins
- Wrote consistently and built momentum
- Created a full content plan

### Challenges
- Social media takes more work than I expected
- Writing meaningful posts slowed down my publishing pace
- SEO results are very early-stage (as expected)
- App development suffered due to other efforts

### Lessons
- Plan newsletters and blog posts so cooking for them can be spread out
- Bulk create social media posts to allow more time for app development
