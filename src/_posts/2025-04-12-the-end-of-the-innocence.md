Sometimes we stay innocent for a good part of our lives. It's a combination of luck and a good dose of denial. Then one day something happens, and it becomes impossible to stay innocent anymore. It's a gut punch. It's a cruel reminder from the universe that you aren't special or immune and neither are your friends.

I think back 16 months to a conversation with my oldest, dearest friend. It was one of those significant moments when you acknowledge time marching forward, and you question how your time is spent. We both agreed we couldn't keep staying in jobs that didn't bring us fulfillment. Time is too short, we said.

I kept my word. I walked away from that job. It wasn't easy, but I did it. Creating a new, meaningful life hasn't been easy, either, but at least I still have a chance to try. I don't know if my friend does. That's the harsh truth.

We don't know how much time we have. The end of innocence reminds us that we can't take anything for granted. We must be bold. We must work with urgency towards meaning. We must push back on the universe for as long as we can.

I realize how significant it is that this reflection is happening in the middle of Easter. The events have forced me to confront the fact that, despite everything we face from the universe, there's a promise of hope. Like everyone, I don't have answers, but I'm grateful I went somewhere to hear that reminder of hope, just yesterday, for both myself and my friend.

I used to say life is short, that we could get hit by a bus at any time. Now I know it's really true. So, if there's something meaningful you want to do, put your heart and soul into it. If there isn't, go on a quest to find it. Money matters, but get ahead of that as soon as you can. Focus on what truly matters, because in the end, we're all running out of time.
