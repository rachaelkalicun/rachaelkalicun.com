On May 10, I was in Erik’s dining room, but he wasn’t there. Just pictures of someone who used to exist. 46 years old. 2 months younger than me.

His aunt and I stood in the dining room. She told me the table and chairs had been her mother’s. Then they were Erik’s mother’s. “You probably remember them from her house,” she said, and I did. Now, they were Erik’s.

That table had held a family and countless birthdays, Christmases, Easters, Thanksgivings, celebrations, and mourning. It held Erik, until it couldn’t anymore.

The table showed me a family completely different from mine: loud, Italian, with protective brothers I never had. Like a proper Italian family, love and pride lived in their food. Erik’s mother opened my eyes to the beauty of a simple, real Italian sauce. Years later, as an adult, I asked her about it, and the technique couldn’t have been simpler.

She was one of the first people who made me feel like my cooking mattered. On Instagram, she cheered me on before I had a project. I think about her all the time when I’m working on Evercooked. I wish she were here to see it grow. I know that if no one else saw the value in it, she would.

The last time I saw Erik was at her funeral on December 15, 2023. I was so grateful to be there to honor her and to support him, but I can’t believe that was the end of Erik and me.

There’s no one like the person who grew up closest to you. He knew parts of me that no one else did. We shared a long stretch of life that shaped us both. There’s something especially sad about losing someone who knew you and loved you before the walls went up.

You can make sense of an 80-year-old dying suddenly, even a healthy one, but not her child. I remember Erik saying at her funeral that he only wished he’d had more years with her. I wish I had more years with Erik in this world.

The world moves on so fast now, doesn’t it? His mother’s funeral was full. People showed up, but there weren’t that many at Erik’s. That disappointed me so much. A young, vibrant, beloved person already being forgotten.

I don’t want people to forget Erik or his mother.
When Erik first died, I started writing down memories, things I didn’t want to lose. I wish I could remember more details, but I don’t want to forget anything else. I’ll keep adding to this list over time. I don’t want to let them slip away.

We were two weird kids who found each other and bonded unconditionally. My best friend. My partner in crime. The boy who put up with a girl’s teenage angst. I want to remember more details like when we really became friends, and how.

What I do remember:

– Your silly laugh\
– Your good nature\
– Winnie the El Camino\
– The accident\
– Singing I’ve Got You Babe at Geauga Lake (where is that tape?)\
– Lattes and learning about fancy coffee at Cherrypickers\
– Pizza (especially spinach!) at Inner Circle\
– Watching Casino with your parents on New Year’s Eve, 1995\
– School trips\
– Band camp\
– The dollar theater\
– The countless movies we watched at your house because your dad owned a video store

We were Gen X kids free to roam the world together.
We were so lucky.

I’m including Erik’s obituary here, too, in case it ever disappears in other places.

Know him even if you never did.

<p>Erik Martin VanBuren, 46, passed away on May 3, 2025, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Born on July 17, 1978, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, Erik lived a life marked by curiosity, compassion, and a vibrant spirit that touched all who knew him.</p>

<p><p>A proud graduate of West Middlesex High School in the Class of 1996, Erik pursued his passion for understanding the human mind and behavior at the University of Pittsburgh, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology in 2001. His dedication to helping others led him to further his education at UPMC Shadyside School of Nursing, where he became a Registered Nurse in 2012. The following year, he advanced his credentials by earning certification as a Certified Addictions Registered Nurse (CARN), reflecting his commitment to supporting individuals facing some of life's most difficult challenges.</p>

Erik's professional journey was defined by empathy and intelligence-qualities that made him not only a skilled nurse but also a trusted presence for those in need. His ability to connect with people on a deep level was matched by his boundless energy and unique sense of humor. Whether offering care to patients or sharing laughter with friends and family, Erik brought light into every room he entered.</p>

<p>Outside of his career, Erik cultivated a rich array of interests that reflected his inquisitive nature and joyful personality. He found peace and satisfaction in gardening-both indoors and out-nurturing life with the same attentiveness he gave to those around him. He delighted in watching television and movies, often sharing recommendations with enthusiasm. A passionate coin collector and avid reader, Erik loved diving into research on nearly any topic that piqued his interest. His love for singing added yet another layer to his expressive soul.</p>

<p>Erik is survived by his beloved husband, Andrew Vincent Gorenz; brothers Timothy Mark Van Buren (Tamara) and Jeffrey Michael Van Buren (Courtney); as well as many nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins who will carry forward memories of his warmth and wit. He was preceded in death by his parents, Jeffrey Martin and Mary Ann Van Buren.</p>

<p>Those who knew Erik will remember him as intelligent and loving-someone whose spirit could brighten even the darkest day and whose empathy left an indelible mark on countless lives. Erik's final act of kindness was to give the gift of life through organ donation. May his memory bring comfort to all who mourn his passing. A Memorial Service will be held on May 10, 2025, from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM at Union Dale Cemetery 2200 Brighton Road. Inurnment will immediately follow memorial service.</p>

<p>In lieu of flowers and other arrangements that are typically sent to a funeral home or church, please consider making a donation towards Erik's Flower Endowment. Funds will go directly towards ensuring Erik's grave receives seasonal flowers and foliage year round. Placement and Maintenance is managed through Union Dale Cemetery.</p>
