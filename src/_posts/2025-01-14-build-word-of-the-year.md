2024 was a memorable year. Maybe I'll write a reflection about it someday, but not now. This is for the new year. This is for 2025.

I was challenged to choose a word for the year, one that would set my intention, my 2025 theme. I considered adjectives: empowered, bold, happy, purposeful. But they all felt vague, so instead, I chose a verb: _build_. 

By consistently practicing this verb, I’m confident those adjectives will naturally fall into place. This year, I just need to build. There’s so much to build: professional projects, the house (in the form of renovations), relationships, muscles, this blog, and my intellect.

I challenge anyone reading this to build with me. Be a builder, not a consumer. Create things, ideas, and experiences. Let the adjectives follow.
