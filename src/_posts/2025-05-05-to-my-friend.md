summary: A poem to my friend...
---

My best friend\
My partner in crime\
My confidante\
The boy who put up with a girl's teenage angst\
Two weird kids that found each other\
Bonded unconditionally

I want to remember more details\
Like when did we really become friends\
How did that happen?

Your silly laugh, your good nature\
Winnie the El Camino\
The accident\
Singing I’ve Got You Babe at Geauga Lake\
The new Sonny and Cher\
Where’s that tape

Lattes at Cherrypickers\
Pizza at Inner Circle\
Watching Casino with your parents on New Year’s Eve in 1995\
School trips, band camp, the dollar theater, the movies we watched at your house

Gen X kids free to roam the world together\
We were so lucky

46 was not long enough\
I hope I will see you again one day, my sweet friend
