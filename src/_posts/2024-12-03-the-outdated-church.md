It’s Advent, a time for reflection and preparation for the celebration of Jesus’ birth. But today, that’s not why I’m thinking about God, Jesus, and organized religion. Unexpectedly, a song I heard at the gym brought back memories of an interaction I had with a priest about a year ago. On that day, I watched how he handled a conversation involving a non-traditional social issue. His reaction seemed un-Christian to me, not aligning with the compassion of Jesus, who loved unconditionally. Remembering that day made me feel sad and disappointed.

Maybe I’m naive to expect more tact and understanding from someone with the title of “man of God,” especially when addressing something officially considered sinful, but I know I’m not the only one. In particular, younger generations are demanding the same. The Church is dying partly because it hasn’t adapted to a more inclusive, liberal world. Ironically, everyone I know, both conservative and liberal, would have responded more compassionately than that priest. None of them officially represent Christianity, yet their innate responses would have aligned more closely with Jesus’ teachings. If I had been searching for a church, thinking about returning, or already a member, I wouldn’t have returned.

As children, many of us were taught that Jesus loved sinners and wanted to bring them closer to God. Yet when leaders fail to exemplify these traits, it drives people away. I’m not fanatically  liberal, “woke,” or young, yet even I felt alienated. It must be even harder for those who are. In today’s savvy world, fewer people tolerate the Church’s hypocrisy in representing the teachings of Jesus. These people value compassion, love, and inclusivity, and they are no longer convinced that eternal damnation is reason enough to attend church. 

If the Church hopes to survive, it must get back to basics and embody Jesus’ message: unconditional love, compassion, and acceptance for all. If it doesn’t, it will continue to become more and more irrelevant.
