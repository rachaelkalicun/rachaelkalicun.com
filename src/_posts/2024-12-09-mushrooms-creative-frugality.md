Frugality can feel like a constraint, and in some ways, it is. Mostly, I’ve approached spending with the mindset of postponing fulfilling experiences for a hazy, unpromised future. It’s hard to see how that mindset will ever shift, considering the scarcity mindset I have ingrained in me. For example, last year, I bought a Thanksgiving-themed candle on clearance after the holiday, with the intention of burning it this Thanksgiving. When I forgot to light it, my immediate reaction was to save it for next year. Reflecting on that moment, I realized how limiting this mindset is, and it made me sad. It assumes resources are finite and that pleasure must be rationed. A healthier approach would be to have faith in abundance and believe that it’s okay to enjoy the present, trusting the future will provide. I should believe that I can buy a new candle next year, even at full price.

Fortunately, frugality isn’t all about restriction. There’s a fun side to it when viewed as an opportunity for creativity and resourcefulness. Today, for example, I didn’t expect to come home with four and a half pounds of mushrooms, but when I spotted those clearance stickers at the grocery store, I felt a rush of glee. The excitement wasn’t entirely about saving money. It was a reason to be creative and resourceful. I thought of the ways I could use them and the satisfaction I’d have in preparing meals in advance.

I quickly decided how I would put the mushrooms to good use. For tonight’s dinner of buckwheat crepes, they’d be sauteed as part of the filling. I would also make the base for two soups: cream of mushroom and mushroom barley, both to freeze and finish later. I’d even get a jump on Christmas prep by making the mushroom-sauerkraut filling for varenyky. So many mushrooms, so much money saved, and so many creative itches scratched. Frugality made me happy today. 

Frugality, when approached as a game, doesn’t feel like a constraint at all. It’s a skill and a challenge. The mushrooms reminded me of the unexpected possibilities of abundance. They were a small reminder that living frugally doesn’t have to be about scarcity. It can be about seeing opportunities, taking on the unexpected, and the satisfaction in turning little into plenty. Today, I didn’t need to postpone my pleasure to some distant future because, by embracing frugality, I was able to find joy in the present.
