Today at the gym, I was practicing yoga balancing poses using a [BOSU Balance Trainer](https://www.amazon.com/BOSU-Exercise-Strength-Flexibility-Rubberized/dp/B077VBYGRQ/ref=sr_1_5){:target="_blank"} with the flat side up as I've been doing for months. A man came up to me and said, "You’re good, but have you tried it the other way? Only people with exceptional balance can do that." I told him I had assumed what I was doing was harder. I sincerely thanked him because I was excited to learn something new and take on a different challenge. I flipped it over, stood on the ball, and he was absolutely right. It was a lot harder. 

This tiny moment in my day reminded me how assumptions and unexamined beliefs can prevent us from growing and hold us back. This assumption could easily have been about something a lot more important or impactful. The moment also reminded me how important it is to boldly make human connections. I never would have spoken up in a situation like this the way he did, but I should. We never know the impact we might have on someone else.
