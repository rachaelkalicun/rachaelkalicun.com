Today I encountered a word I had never heard before while watching Seth Godin's ["Modern Marketing" course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-marketing-with-seth-godin/){:target="_blank"}. The word is "psychographics". It's not graphics that are completely out of their minds. Itâ€™s a customer segmentation concept. 

Similar to how demographics segment people by objective factors like age, gender, education, and location, psychographics segment people by subjective factors like attitudes, beliefs, aspirations, goals, personality types, and lifestyle choices. 

Creating a customer profile using these factors enables highly personal and customized marketing strategies that resonate on a deeper, emotional level than demographics alone.
