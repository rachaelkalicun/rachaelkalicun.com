title: "Coolant Reservoir Replacement in 2006 Saturn Ion"
description: I replaced the coolant tank in my 2006 Saturn Ion to resolve a persistent coolant light and dinging issue. I purchased an OEM radiator surge tank and followed a DIY method using a siphon pump to avoid extra dismantling. Detailed tool list and step-by-step challenges included.

summary: This week, I replaced the coolant tank in my 2006 Saturn Ion after dealing with the coolant light on the dashboard being constantly illuminated for the past year, accompanied by a jarring ding every time I started the car. After investigating, I found that this issue is often caused by a faulty sensor inside the tank since the actual coolant level was fine.

This week, I replaced the coolant tank in my 2006 Saturn Ion after dealing with the coolant light on the dashboard being constantly illuminated for the past year, accompanied by a jarring ding every time I started the car. 

After investigating, I found that this issue is often caused by a faulty sensor inside the tank since the actual coolant level was fine. The "easiest" course of action is replacing the entire reservoir.

I bought an [OEM radiator surge tank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K040LA/){:target="_blank"} and followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obpezmCii2M){:target="_blank"}, but instead of dismantling additional parts to drain the tank through the valve, I pumped the fluid out of the old tank with [this syphon pump](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075C3NNZF?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title){:target="_blank"}. The videoâ€™s method would also have required buying a 7mm socket and a petcock socket.

Tools needed: 
- 10mm socket
- 13mm socket
- Long socket extension
- Pliers for the hose clamps
- A container to drain the fluid into (I used a clean windshield wiper fluid bottle)

Biggest challenges:
- Moving hose clamps on and off with pliers. Buying [hose clamp pliers](https://www.amazon.com/BETOOLL-Reach-Clamp-Pliers-Water/dp/B0C23SHQ59/){:target="_blank"} next time would be worth it! 
- Getting the bracket in the photo below back over the bolt was beyond my ability.

Time spent: 3 hours. It was harder than I expected.

Money spent: $116.42 ($102.04 for reservoir + $14.38 for pump)

Successfully fixed the coolant light? Yes!
