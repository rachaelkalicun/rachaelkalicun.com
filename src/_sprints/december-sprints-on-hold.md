I'm postponing my personal agile process until January after the holidays. On reflection and particularly after reading [_Meditations for Mortals_](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Mortals-Embrace-Limitations-Counts/dp/0374611998){:target="_blank"}, this approach may be too heavy-handed. Accountability is important for me since I don't have a formal structure, but a less restrictive approach may be more reasonable. I will examine the idea of having a "menu" of tasks to choose from over an extended period of time as well as other possibilities. 

For fellow agile and Jira geeks, you can check out what I was attempting to do to run my days with sprints:
