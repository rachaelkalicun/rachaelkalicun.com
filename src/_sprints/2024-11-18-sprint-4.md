	Positives
</p>
1. I got more done with my stricter sprint practice and daily standup notes. 
2. I treated writing as a reward, but this was also a negative. See below.
3. I greatly reduced social media and other negative internet browsing.
4. I got reading time in.
5. I finally started working on previously neglected tasks like house projects.

	Negatives
</p>

1. While I treated writing as a reward, because of this, I didn't actually do it most days.
2. I missed a day at the gym, I missed some meditation sessions, and I did pretty poorly on the evening fitness tasks.
3. I spent a lot of time on Jira automation learning and the blog post. I don't view this as fully negative since I made a conscious decision to keep going with this.  
4. I procrastinated somewhat on house projects even though I made some progress.

	Ways to improve this week
</p>
1. Add less story points per day to try to do more writing. Try to stick to around 5. 
2. Add story points to meditation since it is done during working hours.
4. Keep going with the [FocusGuard Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/focusguard-block-site-foc/ifdepgnnjpnbkcgempionjablajancjc){:target="_blank"}. Complete 4 30-minute work sessions per day with this on.
5. Really try to do the evening fitness task to help with sleep.
6. Don't put off the house projects until later in the day.

- Today: Went to the gym. Cooking app planning around The Practice. Prime the ceiling. Read. Write. 
- Challenges: Losing half a day yesterday to plan this week derailed most things.

- Yesterday: Went to the gym. Reading time. Added h1 when on the home page for SEO. Added my name to meta title for branded searches. Primed the ceiling. Did the longer meditation series.
- Today: Went to the gym. Cooking app planning around The Practice. Texture the ceiling. Read. Write. Rake leaves. 
- Challenges: Did not get to app planning, writing, or evening fitness.  Not everything is getting done. Will need to think about narrowing down priorities.

- Yesterday: Went to the gym. Reading time. Meditated. Attempted to texture the ceiling but the can of texture was too watery and dripped right off the ceiling. I have a sponge being delivered today to try to texture with that instead. Raked leaves. Thought a little more about the cooking app around The Practice. 
- Today: Went to the gym and did the Ashtange yoga video. Texture the ceiling if the sponge comes early enough. Read. Write. Fix markdown on article summaries or get HTML working instead.  
- Challenges: Did not do writing, evening fitness, and one of my meditations. I may rethink my days next week after listening to Tim Ferriss on a podcast about how he structures his days.
